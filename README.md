Count Vectorisation --> CountVectorizer converts a collection of text documents into a matrix where the rows represent the documents, and the columns represent the tokens (words or n-grams). It counts the occurrences of each token in each document, creating a “document-term matrix” with integer values representing the frequency of each token.

Tf-idf --> It is a weighting system that assigns a weight to each word in a document based on its term frequency (tf) and the reciprocal document frequency (tf-idf). The words with higher scores of weight are deemed to be more significant.
